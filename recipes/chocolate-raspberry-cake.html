        <li>baking spray</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cocoa powder, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon all-purpose flour, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 (15.25 ounce) package chocolate cake mix</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>1 (6 ounce) container vanilla yogurt</li>
        <li>1 (3.9 ounce) package instant chocolate pudding mix</li>
        <li>⅓ cup vanilla-flavored vodka</li>
        <li>⅓ cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>½ (12 ounce) package miniature chocolate chips, or more to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Filling</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>12 ounces fresh raspberries, or more to taste</li>
        <li>⅓ cup white sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Frosting</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) container prepared vanilla frosting</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) container frozen nondairy whipped topping, thawed</li>
        <li>3 (1 ounce) squares white chocolate, melted and cooled</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 9-inch round cake pans with baking spray. Mix cocoa and flour together and use to flour the pans.</li>
        <li>Combine cake mix, water, vanilla yogurt, pudding mix, vodka, vegetable oil, and eggs in a large bowl. Mix on low speed until moistened. Mix on medium speed for 2 minutes, then stir in chocolate chips. Divide batter evenly into the prepared cake pans.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the centers spring back at your touch, 40 to 50 minutes. Cool in the pans for 5 minutes. Run a table knife around the edges to loosen. Invert carefully onto a serving plate or cooling rack and let cool completely, about 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, combine raspberries and sugar for filling in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook, stirring frequently, until they reduce by about 50%. Set aside to cool.</li>
        <li>Slice each cooled cake layer horizontally into two layers. Place the bottom layer on a serving plate and top with 1/3 of the filling. Repeat with 2 more layers and remaining filling. Top with final layer. </li>
        <li>Combine vanilla frosting, whipped topping, and melted white chocolate in a large mixing bowl; mix on high speed until smooth and creamy.</li>
        <li>Frost the top and sides of the cake. Decorate with extra chocolate chips and/or raspberries, if desired. Chill for at least 1 hour before serving.</li>
    </ol>
